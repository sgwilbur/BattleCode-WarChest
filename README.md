## BattleCode Archive

The goal is to provide a collection of teams that have published their code online in a git super repository with submodules where possible or reference to any other repositories I may have come across.

Checkout [http://battlecode.org](http://battlecode.org) for details on the most recent or upcoming BattleCode season.

This repository is meant as a helper to aggregate a number of different repositories together for source code review and help in identifying winning strategies. Since the game mechanics are altered each year there is little use in copying too much old code, but it is helpful to see how other teams do analysis and coordinate strategy during a match.

Not all teams repositories are created equal but the general model here is <year>/teams<team> for browsing this should be fine, if you are trying to automated building against you may need to get smarter, hardcode some values per team, or re-clone their repos to clean them up yourself :)
